\chapter{Acquiring Financial Data\label{Acquiring Financial Data}}
The first chapter of this book is dedicated to a very important (some may say the most important) part of any data science/quantitative finance project—gathering data. In line with the famous adage “garbage in, garbage out,” we should strive to obtain data of the highest possible quality and then correctly preprocess it for later use with statistical and machine learning algorithms.
